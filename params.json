That means you can only use it with angular and you need to include it as an angular module in addition to loading it.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nangular.module('App', ['halfsies'])\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nThe halfsies services is simply a function that takes in a string of halfsies templates and returns the corresponding html.\r\n\r\nThis is how it would work in a controller.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction AppController ($scope, halfsies) {\r\n  $scope.renderHalfsiesTemplate = function (templateString) {\r\n    return halfsies(templateString)\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
